Hey there im Aziz , As a Web Developer i want to create a music app so that every user listen to their favourite music instead of searching all around , and for me 
in order to easily find and listen to my favourite songs as a music fan i would like to organise my best songs into playlists


* you can search for your music vocally 
* you can add a song to multiple playlists
* a song can only be added once in a playlist
* every playlist should have a unique name
* as a user i want to sign up with phone number and email to add an extra layer of security
